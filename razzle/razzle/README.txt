Project Proposal

Razzle - Ecommerce Website

 I plan on making an ecommerce website that sells handmade goods, similar to etsy.
I'm torn on making it more of a standalone single seller( myself) website or
having it be open for anyone to post their products; so for now in terms of the 
scope of the MVP I think we'll just leave it to me. The user will be able to see
the main page upon entering the site and see featured items above the rest of 
the content. They will be able to add items to cart and calculate shipping 
estimates. If they click on an item they will see a description, picture and 
price. The user can also sign in to see their favorited items or items ordered.
There will be an admin sign in as well that allows new items to be added or 
changed. I plan on making this fully functional with a payment gateway provider
and launching it thru aws.

MVP:
- Webpages with products and descriptions etc, organized by categories
- User can add products to cart and get estimated shipping and total price
- User can login/register for additional features (favorites, past orders)
- Admin login for altering sites catalog, viewing customer orders
- User can make successful payment thru paypal or stripe

Backlog:
- Allow users to post their own products
- Add review section for products or of the seller
- Launched thru AWS so it is publicly available
- Refined styling
